## Before                      
You should read about SVG and CSS animations with clip-path Documentation here:

Using clip-path CSS property do the next steps:

- Animate the current image using clip-path:
    -  The animation should change each 4s and should be an infinite loop.
    -  The figures for the animation should be:
        - 0%: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 100%, 0% 100%)
        - 20%: polygon(28% 0, 73% 0, 100% 100%, 0% 100%)
        - 40%: polygon(0 0, 100% 72%, 100% 100%, 0 35%)
        - 60%: polygon(50% 0, 50% 0, 100% 100%, 0% 100%)
